Description
===========

This repository contains a C library for evaluating higher-dimensional
modular equations by analytic methods. As it stands now, only a few
types of modular equations in genus g=2 are supported, either over the
rationals or prime finite fields:

- Modular equations of Siegel type in Igusa invariants;

- Modular equations of Hilbert type in Igusa invariants, using
  parametrizations of Humbert surfaces for all fundamental
  discriminants less than 100;

- Modular equations of Hilbert type in Gundlach invariants for
  discriminant 5.

Along the way, the library provides functionality for the evaluation
of genus 2 theta constants in quasi-linear time. The algorithms are
described in the associated paper `[K21]`_.

Prerequisites
=============

An installation of `Arb`_ version 2.21.0 or later, and `Flint`_
version 2.8.0 or later.

Installation
============

Save a copy of `Makefile.in` as `Makefile` at the top of the source
tree, and modify the variables `CURDIR` and `MYDIR` as appropriate. To
compile the library, run::
  make
  
This will produce an archive file `libhdme.a` in the source directory. The
Makefile also responds to the standard commands::
  make tests
  make check
  make clean
  
Documentation
=============

See the `doc` folder for the documentation of the individual
modules. For examples of usage, look at the test files in the `test`
subfolder of each module.

Example programs are also available in the `time` subfolder of certain
modules. To compile and run them, use::
  make time
  
This will take a few minutes. Otherwise, these programs can be run
individually from the `build/time` subfolder of the source
directory. Then::
  make plots

will produce simple graph representations of the raw data in the
`time` subfolder of the source directory, if a Python interpreter is
available.
  
Credits
=======

- The code for fast evaluation of theta constants using Arb is
  inspired by the `cmh`_ library by Andreas Enge and Emmanuel Thom√©.

- The code written by `Enea Milio`_ has been useful in the
  implementation of Mestre's algorithm and to implement the inversion
  of the Hilbert embedding.

- The design and semantics of many functions are inspired from existing
  functions in the libraries Flint and Arb, maintained by William Hart
  and Fredrik Johansson.
